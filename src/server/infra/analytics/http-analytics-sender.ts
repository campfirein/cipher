/**
 * Bridges the M10.1 `IAnalyticsSender` contract over an
 * `IAnalyticsHttpClient`. The sender owns wire-format composition
 * (records → `AnalyticsBatch`) and request-level header assembly
 * (device id, session id, user-agent); the http client owns transport
 * (timeout, status classification, network errors).
 *
 * Mapping rules:
 *   - Empty input → `{succeeded: [], failed: []}` without an HTTP call.
 *   - HTTP success → every input id classified as `succeeded`.
 *   - HTTP failure (timeout / 4xx / 5xx / network) → every input id
 *     classified as `failed`; M9.2's retry-cap inside `JsonlAnalyticsStore.
 *     updateStatus(_, 'failed')` increments `attempts` and terminates rows
 *     at MAX_ATTEMPTS. Backoff (M4.5) reacts to the structured failure
 *     reason later.
 *
 * Per-record granularity is intentionally collapsed here: the backend's
 * 200 response is batch-level (it counts accepted/rejected internally
 * via `IngestBatchResult` but does not surface per-event ids). All-or-
 * nothing matches that contract.
 *
 * MUST NOT throw — analytics MUST NOT crash the daemon. Collaborator
 * failures (e.g. globalConfigStore disk error) are caught and surface
 * as `failed` so the retry policy can react.
