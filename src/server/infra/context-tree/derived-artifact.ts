/**
 * Derived-artifact predicates for the Hierarchical DAG architecture.
 *
 * Three predicates with clear separation of concerns:
 * - isDerivedArtifact()  — non-searchable derived content (excluded from query fingerprint)
 * - isArchiveStub()      — searchable stubs (included in BM25 index and fingerprint)
 * - isExcludedFromSync() — derived + stubs that should NOT participate in snapshot/sync/merge/push.
 *                          index.html is the one derived artifact that IS synced so peers can
 *                          consume the latest navigation index without running `brv index rebuild`.
