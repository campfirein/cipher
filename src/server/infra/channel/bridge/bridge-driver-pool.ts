 * Phase 9 / Slice 9.4f — profile-keyed warm driver pool for the
 * Bob-side parley dispatcher.
 *
 * Replaces the per-query subprocess spawn shipped in 9.4c
 * (`local-agent-response-generator.ts` TODO + kimi round-1 LOW-C). One
 * `IAcpDriver` (i.e. one ACP subprocess) is kept warm per profile name
 * and reused across inbound parley queries. A hard cap on the number
 * of in-flight drivers per profile prevents resource exhaustion under
 * concurrent inbound traffic: when the cap is reached, `acquire()`
 * throws `PARLEY_LOCAL_AGENT_BUSY` so the parley-server projects it
 * as a signed `error` terminal frame back to the dialer (fail-fast,
 * no head-of-line blocking).
 *
 * The pool does NOT start a driver eagerly — drivers spawn lazily on
 * the first `acquire()` for a profile that has an idle slot. Drivers
 * that fail `start()` do NOT consume a slot (the reservation is
 * rolled back so the next acquire can retry).
