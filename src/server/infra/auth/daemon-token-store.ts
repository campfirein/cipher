/**
 * Daemon-token store for local channel auth (CHANNEL_PROTOCOL.md §2 + DESIGN
 * §5.6 step 1). Phase 1 ships read-or-generate persistence; origin hardening
 * and the `--rotate-auth-token` command are deferred to Phase 3.
 *
 * Storage layout (relative to {@link getGlobalDataDir}):
 *   <data-dir>/state/daemon-auth-token   (mode 0600)
 *
 * Behaviour:
 *   - If the file exists with mode 0600 and non-empty contents, return it.
 *   - If the file is missing, generate a fresh 256-bit token and write it
 *     atomically with mode 0600.
 *   - If the file exists with wrong permissions (POSIX), regenerate. This
 *     ensures a tampered/loosened file is not silently trusted.
 *   - Windows: POSIX permission checks are skipped because Node's `mode` on
 *     Windows does not faithfully reflect ACLs. The token file is still
 *     created and read from disk; tighter Windows-native ACLs are a follow-up.
