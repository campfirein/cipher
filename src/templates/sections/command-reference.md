### `brv curate`

**Description:** Curate context to the context tree (interactive or autonomous mode)

**Arguments:**

- `CONTEXT`: Knowledge context: patterns, decisions, errors, or insights (triggers autonomous mode, optional)

**Flags:**

- `--files`, `-f`: Include file paths for critical context (max 5 files, relative paths only). **CONTEXT argument must come BEFORE this flag.**

**Good examples of context:**

- "Auth uses JWT with 24h expiry. Tokens stored in httpOnly cookies via authMiddleware.ts"
- "API rate limit is 100 req/min per user. Implemented using Redis with sliding window in rateLimiter.ts"

**Bad examples:**

- "Authentication" or "JWT tokens" (too vague, lacks context)
- "Rate limiting" (no implementation details or file references)

**Examples:**

```bash
# Interactive mode (manually choose domain/topic)
brv curate

# Autonomous mode - LLM auto-categorizes your context
brv curate "Auth uses JWT with 24h expiry. Tokens stored in httpOnly cookies via authMiddleware.ts"

# Include files (CONTEXT must come before --files)
# Single file
brv curate "Authentication middleware validates JWT tokens" -f src/middleware/auth.ts

# Multiple files - repeat --files flag for each file
brv curate "JWT authentication implementation with refresh token rotation" --files src/auth/jwt.ts --files docs/auth.md
```

**Behavior:**

- Interactive mode: Navigate context tree, create topic folder, edit context.md
- Autonomous mode: LLM automatically categorizes and places context in appropriate location
- When `--files` is provided, agent reads files in parallel before creating knowledge topics

**Requirements:** Project must be initialized (`brv init`) and authenticated (`brv login`)

### `brv query`

**Description:** Query and retrieve information from the context tree

**Arguments:**

- `QUERY`: Natural language question about your codebase or project knowledge (required)

**Good examples of queries:**

- "How is user authentication implemented?"
- "What are the API rate limits and where are they enforced?"

**Bad examples:**

- "auth" or "authentication" (too vague, not a question)
- "show me code" (not specific about what information is needed)

**Examples:**

```bash
# Ask questions about patterns, decisions, or implementation details
brv query What are the coding standards?
brv query How is authentication implemented?
```

**Behavior:**

- Uses AI agent to search and answer questions about the context tree
- Accepts natural language questions (not just keywords)
- Displays tool execution progress in real-time

**Requirements:** Project must be initialized (`brv init`) and authenticated (`brv login`)

## Best Practices

### Efficient Workflow

1. **Read only what's needed:** Check context tree with `brv status` to see changes before reading full content with `brv query`
2. **Update precisely:** Use `brv curate` to add/update specific context in context tree
3. **Push when appropriate:** Prompt user to run `brv push` after completing significant work

### Context tree Management

- Use `brv curate` to directly add/update context in the context tree
