/**
 * Ctrl+Q keybind that cancels the most recently started curate / query task.
 *
 * Scoped via Ink's `useInput` `isActive` — the binding only fires while there
 * is a non-terminal task in the tasks store. When no cancellable task exists,
 * Ctrl+Q is a no-op so the keybind never steals input from other surfaces.
 *
 * Why scoped here instead of inside curate-flow / query-flow: those components
 * unmount as soon as the daemon acks task:create (< 100ms), so they cannot
 * own a keybind that needs to be active for the entire task lifetime.
 *
 * RESERVED CHORD WARNING (read before binding Ctrl+Q anywhere else in the TUI):
 * - This keybind is mounted globally via `app-providers.tsx → CancelKeybindInitializer`,
 *   so as soon as ANY non-terminal task exists in the tasks store, Ctrl+Q is
 *   intercepted everywhere — text inputs, REPL prompt, search box, modals, etc.
 * - DO NOT bind Ctrl+Q to any other action while a curate/query/dream task can
 *   be in flight; the global cancel will eat the chord first.
 * - The binding targets `selectCancelTargetTaskId`'s "most recently created
 *   non-terminal task." With multiple in-flight tasks, Ctrl+Q always cancels
 *   the most recent one, not the one currently focused in the UI.
 * - There is no confirmation step today — the cancel network round-trip starts
 *   the instant the chord lands. If a real-world conflict surfaces (user
 *   accidentally cancelling), the recommended follow-up is to mirror the SIGINT
 *   double-tap pattern in `installSigintCancel` (first Ctrl+Q arms, second
 *   within Ns fires).
