 * of operation judgment — so `brv review pending` stayed empty for any
 * user-initiated curate.
 *
 * `CurateMeta` is the calling agent's hook into the HITL pipeline: the
 * agent that authored the HTML is also best-positioned to assert what
 * kind of operation it is and whether it's load-bearing enough to need
 * review. All fields are optional — agents that don't supply meta still
 * curate successfully, just without review surfacing.
 *
 * Lives in `src/shared/` because the wire-payload encoder
 * (`shared/transport/curate-html-content.ts`) must import it; placing
 * the type under `src/server/` would force `shared → server` direction.
